> Node.js application that can execute code on an interval basis to create a historical set of data. Based on a Gulp task I wrote in 2015 that can execute and save CSS Stats automatically on predefined intervals, thus creating a historical set of CSS Stats.

## To Do

- ~~Import legacy code~~
- Split up functionality (interval vs. CSS Stats functionality) & decouple from Gulp
- Update JS to modern standards
